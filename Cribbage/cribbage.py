        When a player is unable to lay a card because it would cause the total to 
            go over 31, they call a 'Go'. This means the other player has the chance
            to keep playing upto 31. They must continue to play until they are unable
            to play any more cards. They can continue to score pairs, straights, 15s and 31s
        The one tricky part is the person who can still play gets 1 point at the start of the
            Go process, but not for every subsequent one. Ex:
                cardTotal is 22 (player 1 only has cards worth 10 in hand so cannot lay)
                player 1 calls 'Go', and player 2 scores 1 point
                player 2 lays  4,4 bringing the total to 30 and they are out of cards
                Player2 scores a total of 1 point for the go plus 2 for the pair
                    giving them 3 points.
            So to track this, need 2 state variables:
                1) Was the last players turn a go?
                    * if it is and this players turn is a go, neither can lay cards and reset
                2) Is the game in a 'go state' where one player cannot go, but the oher can
                    need to track so they can keep laying cards without scoring a point every time
